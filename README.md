# SP3-Store-Systemer: MyDRTV Solution Architecture Report

## Introduction
This report presents the proposed solution architecture and technology stack for the MyDRTV project, a digital transformation initiative for Denmarkâ€™s state broadcaster. The platform aims to promote Danish TV and film globally by offering access to a vast collection of old TV programs and films. Key features include user ratings, advanced search, personalized recommendations, and GDPR-compliant user interaction.

The report outlines our systematic approach to selecting the technology stack and architecture, comparing different architectural styles like layered and microservices. The architecture design will be supported by diagrams, including use case, domain model, and sequence diagrams.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The MyDRTV platform is designed to provide:
- Access to a global audience for Danish TV and films.
- User accounts with rating and interaction features.
- Advanced search capabilities based on year, title, genre, and other filters.
- Personalized recommendations through a "More Programs You May Like" feature.
- High availability and compliance with GDPR for handling personally identifiable information (PII).

### Key Functional Requirements
- **User Interaction:** Account creation, ratings, and conversations on TV programs and films.
- **Search System:** Advanced search using multiple filters such as year of production, title, and genre.
- **Personalization:** A recommendation system based on user ratings and interaction.
- **High Availability:** Ensuring uninterrupted global access to content.
- **GDPR Compliance:** Secure handling of PII with compliance to European regulations.

## Architectural Approach

### Architectural Styles Comparison
We considered multiple architectural styles for the MyDRTV project. Below is a summary of the criteria used in our comparison: 

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Typescript React. This choose is made over Javascript becuase we would like strongly typed language and gives better tooling then Javascript. Then React was choosen because it makes coding dynamic applications easier to write and more performant aswell as when we're already familiar with react beforehand.

- **Backend:** We have choosen C# because its obejct-oriented and uses dotnet which gives access to Entity Framework (EF). EF is a object-relation mapper which makes it easier to make CRUD operations in a relational database. Other programming langauges also have object-relation mapper like JPA for Java but we like how easy and intuative EF is to use.

- **Database:** We think PostgreSQL is a suitable choice because it is a relational database and we think i simple to use.

- **Search Engine:** PostgreSQL already has a build in search engine this will be the way we will use to search. But if that is not effecient enough we will make a search engine that suites our needs. 

- **Recommendation Engine:** We will implement an machine learning algorithm that would use these factors for the recommendations:
    - The interactions the user has with the service ( such as viewing history and how they rated other titles),
    - Other members with similar tastes and preferences on our service, and
    - Informaiton about the titles, such as their genre, categories, actors, release year, etc.

    In addition to knowing what they have watches on MyDRTV, to best personalize the recommendations we also consider factors including:

    - the time of day they're watching
    - the languages your prefer
    - the device they're watching on, and
    - how long they've enjoyed a title.

- **Infrastructure:** We will use AWS to hold our infratructure. Using there RDS to host the database and EKS to host pods of the front- and backend. Kubernetes can also insure that the application has all must no down time. AWS was choosen becuase we have used in previous exeperience. 

## System Design

### Subsystems Overview (Bounded Contexts in Domain-Driven Design)
The system will be decomposed into the following bounded contexts:
1. **User Management:** Responsible for user accounts, authentication, and handling GDPR compliance.
2. **Ratings & Interactions:** Manages ratings, comments, and recommendations.
3. **Search & Content Delivery:** Provides advanced search functionality and efficient content delivery.
4. **Recommendation Engine:** Delivers personalized recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.

### Key Diagrams
- **Use Case Diagram:** Shows the main interactions between users and the system.
- **Domain Model:** Visualizes the main business concepts (e.g., User, Program, Rating).
- **Sequence Diagram:** Describes interactions between subsystems, such as how user ratings impact recommendations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### High Availability
- **Redundancy & Failover:** Cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling and load balancing will ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Scalability**

### Security & GDPR Compliance
- **Data Protection:** User PII will be encrypted and stored securely. Regular audits and compliance checks will ensure GDPR adherence.
- **User Privacy:** Clear user consent for data processing, with tools for data anonymization and deletion upon request.

### Performance
- **Response Time:** The system will be optimized for minimal latency, especially for content search and personalized recommendations.
- **Load Balancing:** Advanced load balancing will ensure consistent performance during peak times.

## Risk Management

### Reputational Risk
- A robust ratings system is critical for user trust and engagement. The architecture ensures accuracy and fairness in ratings and recommendations.

### Legal and Compliance Risks
- GDPR compliance is non-negotiable. Mismanagement of PII could lead to severe legal repercussions and loss of user trust. Security audits and compliance checks will be a regular part of the development cycle.
